Hey, I'm balverine! I enjoy modding Stardew Valley and got started almost as soon as I started playing

I'm still learning how to write C# so as of right now I just make content packs

Main interests:

- Arts and crafts

- Pixel art

- Cosplay

- Stardew Valley

- Metal Gear Solid

- Animal Crossing

- Harvest Moon/Story of Seasons

- Anime (pretty much anything with the fantasy/supernatural genres are cool. One Piece, Durarara!! and Fire Force are current faves)

- Geology

Other games I mod:

- Sims 3

- Mario Kart 8

- Sonic adventure 2
